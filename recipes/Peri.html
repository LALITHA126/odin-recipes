  <h3>This peri peri chicken recipe features a great spicy marinade for an African dish that's great for a barbecue. Nice with salad and fries, but I like adding it to a pita with salad and garlic Greek yogurt (3/4 cup Greek yogurt and 3 cloves of crushed garlic with finely chopped chives). Don't go on a date, though; it gives you wicked garlic breath! , Recipe by UKNO1CHEF"</h3>

      <h4>Directions</h4>
      <p>Here's a very brief overview of what you can expect when you make homemade lasagna:</p>
      <ol>
          <li>Stir together lemon juice, paprika, chili powder, garlic, ginger, and salt in a large bowl until well combined. Add chicken; rub until well coated and marinate in the refrigerator for 3 hours.</li>
          <li>Preheat a grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grates.</li>
          <li>Place chicken onto the preheated grill; discard marinade. Cook, turning occasionally, until skins are slightly charred and the juices run clear, about 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of chicken should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
      </ol>
